We make several contributions in this work. We propose a general-purpose framework allowing for a game-theoretic analysis of QKD protocols. Our method is the first such framework to allow for critical security computations, as mentioned, and we demonstrate this on several protocols and attack scenarios. Furthermore, the method proposed in this work requires fewer assumptions made on the part of the honest users, which makes it more useful. We show how our method can be applied to practical, real-world devices (which, to our knowledge, has never been considered in any previous game-theoretic approaches). Finally, we make several interesting observations about the efficiency and noise tolerances of QKD protocols operating against rational adversaries. In particular, we show that, under natural assumptions, if an adversary is rational, as opposed to simply malicious, users may increase QKD key generation rates beyond what is possible in the standard adversarial model. Unlike other game theoretic models, we show how important key-rate and noise tolerance computations may be performed through our system allowing for interesting comparisons to the ‚Äústandard adversarial model‚Äù of QKD. We show that, depending on the relative cost of operating devices, increased noise tolerance and improved secure communication rates are possible if one assumes adversaries are rational as opposed to being malicious.\n","date":1615519935,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1615519935,"objectID":"8dd044fef87a2cb129fb0fe66780eaba","permalink":"https://songyanghan.github.io/project/game-theoretic-security-framework-for-quantum-cryptography/","publishdate":"2021-03-12T03:32:15.998Z","relpermalink":"/project/game-theoretic-security-framework-for-quantum-cryptography/","section":"project","summary":"We analyze quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols through a game theoretic framework.

Information shared among autonomous vehicles provides opportunities to better coordination schemes and also raises novel challenges. In the future, connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) equipped with both self-driving technology and V2V connectivity, will lead to vastly improved road safety and efficient traffic flow. However, existing literature for connected vehicles or platoons still lacks understanding of the tridirectional relationship among communication, learning, and control of CAVs. Questions such as under what conditions coordination among vehicles can be built, or how to take the best advantage of shared information to improve safety of the connected vehicles and efficiency of the traffic flow remain challenging. Hence, it is critical for future connected autonomous vehicles systems to operate based on integrated learning and control theories, techniques and coordination protocols under complicated environments. This project aims to build fundamental theories and implement experiments for a safe and efficient decision-making process of autonomous vehicles under dynamic and uncertain environment. The benefits of sharing different types of information is analyzed at different scales, from system level efficiency to safety guarantee of each individual autonomous vehicle. Experiments will be implemented with both 1/10th scale racing cars and full-scale autonomous vehicles on Uconn Depot Campus by collaborating with¬†the Connecticut Transportation Safety Research Center.\n","date":1615518795,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1615518795,"objectID":"9f00ccfb9c2cc28cfb550e2fc107d45d","permalink":"https://songyanghan.github.io/project/learning-and-control-for-connected-autonomous-vehicles/","publishdate":"2021-03-12T03:13:15.325Z","relpermalink":"/project/learning-and-control-for-connected-autonomous-vehicles/","section":"project","summary":"Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) wireless connectivity is the next frontier in road transportation, which will greatly benefit the safety and reliability of autonomous cars.

We formulate this problem as a hybrid system partially observable Markov decision process to consider objectives such as improving traffic flow efficiency, driving comfort and safety requirements. The feedback deep Q-learning algorithm we design aims to solve the critical challenge of reinforcement learning (RL) for a hybrid system model: guaranteeing the safety of the dynamic system while the RL is exploring the action space to increase the reward. We prove that our method renders a forward invariant safe set for the continuous state space physical system dynamic model while the RL agent is learning in discrete action space. In experiments, our behavior planning method can increase traffic flow and driving comfort of CAVs compared with the literature. We also validate that our method maintains safety during the learning process.","tags":[],"title":"Behavior Planning For Connected Autonomous Vehicles Using Feedback Deep Reinforcement Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Songyang Han","Jie Fu","Fei Miao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1575158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575158400,"objectID":"86ba934dadcb6cee893c9cc8ef3c97f7","permalink":"https://songyanghan.github.io/publication/-cdc19/","publishdate":"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/-cdc19/","section":"publication","summary":"As communication technologies develop, an autonomous vehicle will receive information not only from its own sensing system but also from infrastructures and other vehicles through communication. This paper discusses how to exploit a sequence of future information that is shared among autonomous vehicles, including the planned positions, the velocities and the lane numbers. A hybrid system model is constructed, and a control policy is designed to utilize shared sequence information for making navigation decisions. For the high-level discrete state transitions, the shared information is used to determine when to change lane, if lane changing will bring reward for the autonomous vehicle and there exists a feasible continuous state controller. For the low-level continuous state space controller generation, the shared information can relax the safety interval constraints in the existing model predictive control method. In the system level, the information sharing can increase the traffic flow and improve driving comfort. We demonstrate the advantages of information sharing in control and navigation in simulation.","tags":[],"title":"Exploiting Beneficial Information Sharing Among Autonomous Vehicles","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?

It is soft-switching based and able to achieve high efficiency at MHz frequency. However, the converter implemented through traditional static design is sensitive to the variations of operation condition. Its performance gets deteriorated when DC load and coil coupling deviate from their respective optimum values. This paper demonstrates that the degradation of system efficiency is mostly due to the mismatch of PA load, and the efficiency drop can be efficiently improved by adding an L-type impedance matching network (IMN) after PA. A fixed IMN is sufficient to maintain a high efficiency, while a tunable IMN is required to ensure stable output power when operation condition dramatically changes. Key techniques, particularly system-level optimization, are discussed in this paper that ensure high efficiency over a wide range of variation in operation condition and also with reduced capacitor/inductor tuning ranges in the IMN. The 6.78-MHz Class E 2 DC-DC converters with and without the fixed/tunable IMN are fabricated and measured for validation purposes. The experimental results show that both high efficiency (66%) and stable output power (around 9 W) are maintained for the tunable converter when there are variations in the DC load and coil coupling.","tags":[],"title":"Tunable Class E2 DC‚ÄìDC Converter With High Efficiency and Stable Output Power for 6.78-MHz Wireless Power Transfer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Songyang Han","He Yin","Amro Alsabbagh","Chengbin Ma"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1512086400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1512086400,"objectID":"80a46a822c352a9a3432112fa67505b0","permalink":"https://songyanghan.github.io/publication/isie17/","publishdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/isie17/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper studies an energy management problem for an isolated microgrid including photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, batteries and ultracapacitors.

The solution of this game represented by Nash equilibrium is analytically derived and proved to be the existing and unique. A simulation platform using data in second is established to study the energy management approach based on probability distribution functions. In simulation, the game theory based approach has a comparable performance against the rule based control, while the pre-knowledge of the load demands and weather information is not required.
